        About me
      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Matheus Borges, an SRE/DevOps engineer with experience in infrastructure automation, cloud computing, and CI/CD best practices. I work with tools like <b>Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Docker, and GitHub Actions</b> to turn infrastructure into reliable, scalable, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began by managing a LAN house, where I developed both technical and <b>interpersonal skills</b> while handling customer service and performing computer and systems maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          That early experience sparked my interest in technology and led me to enroll in a Technical Program in Informatics, where <b>I wrote my first lines of code using Java</b> and other tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I earned my first internship working with PHP, and I <b>currently work at TOTVS</b>, developing automated solutions for a wide range of challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly evolving, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and continuously learning, guided by the philosophy of <b>lifelong learning</b>.
